# KEditors Suite

A suite of stable, neovim-centred development environments and configurations.

Remember: `plugins.lua` is a separate file and for the KEditors developers, 
you will need to sync both init.lua and plugins.lua.

## Neovim CiDER Types 

In CiDER there are two kinds of editors, personal and professional (both being free of course!)

In the personal versions:

* Primarily focused on a specific language or field of discussion, with an easy interface and simple keybinds
* Contains the standard intelligent editor features one would expect
* Stable, ensures that no errors get in your way of adding new configurations, etc.

In the professional editions:

* Everything from personal
* **+ the added tooling and custom-built support for certain actions.**
* **+ EVEN FURTHER stability checks for professional neovim-based work environments**
* **+ A broader field and spectrum of languages which are supported by different kinds of Professional editions**
